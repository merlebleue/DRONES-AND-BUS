A comparative study was conducted to analyze the impact of using real data on delivery simulation metrics across three different cases. The first case utilized synthetic bus lines and tasks as a baseline scenario. The second case focused on the area surrounding Bus Line 705, while the third case analyzed task generation in the Lausanne metropolitan area. The findings indicate that real data significantly enhances the probability that bus-based deliveries reduce drone travel distances. Moreover, task distributions generated using real data more accurately reflect real-world delivery demands, demonstrating the advantages of this approach over synthetic modeling.
We now introduce 2 examples of using our code to generate real data in two different contexts :
